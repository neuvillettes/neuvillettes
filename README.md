<li>JJBA is my main interest, I will talk about it a lot.</li>
<li>I don't particularly enjoy doubles for any of my kins, but I make exceptions for friends.<br>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I consider my kins to be me irl. I will call them me irl. If this upsets you, I don't care. Find someone who does. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am mostly AFK/Off-Tab, whispers are best to get a reply from me. Don't be afraid to chat, I love conversation!</li>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I can often talk too much, or I get burnt out quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't mind anybody sitting with me or my friends, I won't yell at you for doing it like most people do.</li>
<li>Please do not copy my skins, if I feel like you're copying me, I will hide you. This goes for inspo as well, please ask me first, I say yes more often than not.</li>
